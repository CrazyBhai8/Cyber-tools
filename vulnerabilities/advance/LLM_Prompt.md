## 🤖 What is a Large Language Model?

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a type of **AI** that can **read and write like a human**.

It works by **predicting the next word** in a sentence, so it can give smart and realistic answers to your questions.

## 🧠 How does it learn?

It learns by reading **a huge amount of text** from the internet — like websites, books, and articles.
Then it figures out how words usually fit together in a sentence.

---

## 💬 How do you use it?

You type something into a **chat box** — this is called a **prompt**.
The LLM reads your prompt and replies based on what it learned.

Sometimes, it checks your input first (called **input validation**) to make sure it's okay to respond.
